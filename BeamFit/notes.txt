Lots of FP errors with use_xy = True

possibly a problem with rho ~ +/-1?
store determinant factor separately for this case?
further evidence: don't get the error when you start with sigma_rho=0.2 vs 0.6

Warning: overflow encountered in exp  (gauss2d)
Warning: overflow encountered in multiply (chi2)
Warning: overflow encountered in true_divide

and get this every time 
Warning: invalid value encountered in true_divide
 I think due to some zeros in the statistics (/ana[0]) when some parameters are fixed??

need to be able to specify use_xy in processbeamdata

but otherwise the _xy version is much more sensible, as there's no angle ambiguity.
