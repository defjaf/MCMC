out_UL2: DLC_UL=2 Removing 12micron, 353 GHz, 217GHz; 25micron UL
         (unfortunately, not sure what all the individual subfiles with overlapping names are...)
out_next0: DLC_UL=1 with next=0 flag only (no extended sources) AND color correction
           two separate runs due to memory errors (and index errors so no final out_[?].pickle files produced)
           writeTabAll run on the check{0,1}.npy files and combined by hand to produce the final tables
