Hi,

Attached is the numbers table for ULIRG photometry to be used for SED fits.

Column titles are of the form F-wavelength in microns_Jy for fluxes, E-wavelength-in-microns_Jy for flux errors eg. F100_Jy for 100 micron flux. All fluxes are in Jy.

Where there is no value given the data don't exist. As you'll see the coverage is far from uniform.

25 micron fluxes should be treated as upper limits for the fits as hotter dust will dominate here.

You already have lots of Arp220 fluxes, so use those rather than the incomplete list in this table.

There will be some more fluxes coming from the PACS instrument but I can't get at them yet.

Have fun!

Dave
